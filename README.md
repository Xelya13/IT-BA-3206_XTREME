### Introduction

Who would have thought that the past will greatly influence the way people of the present lives? Remains from plants and animals thatvexisted million years ago are now playing a major role on how we humans live our life. These remains are the so called "Fossil Fuels" which are considered as source for non-renewable energy that are being used in different aspects of life. Fossil fuels are essential for human survival and daily living, and they are the world's principal energy source. They are utilized in the production of ordinary products such as computers, cosmetic parts,paint, and household appliances, as well as for heating, transportation, and electricity. Most common source of non-renewable energy are typically known as coal, crude oil, and natural gases. When it comes to the high carbon content caol is the highest with 223 pounds of carbon dioxided per million British thermal units, followed by oil with 163 pounds of carbon dioxide per million Brithish units, and lastly natural gases with 117 pounds of carbon dioxide per million British thermal units.

All of the countries in the world benefits from the existence of fossil fuels while the world itself suffers from its recoil. The Earth's atmosphere takes damage for every non-renewable energy that are being used. When fossil fuels are burned, massive volume of carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas, are also released into the atmosphere. Global Warming is caused by greenhouse gases, which trap heat in our atmosphere. The average global temperature has already risend by 1 degree Celsius. Warming exceeding 1.5 degree Celsius increases the risk o rising sea levels, harsh weather, biodiversity loss and extinction, food scarcity, and increasing health anfd poverty of millions of people arond the world.
