## Introduction
Who would have thought that the past will greatly influence the way people of the present lives? Remains from plants and animals that existed millions of years ago play a major role in how we humans live our lives. These remains are the so-called "Fossil Fuels" which are considered a source of non-renewable energy that is being used in different aspects of life. Fossil Fuels are essential for human survival and daily living, and they are the world's principal energy source. They are utilized in the production of ordinary products such as computers, cosmetics, paint, household appliances, heating, transportation, and electricity generation. The most common source of non-renewable energy is typically known as coal, crude oil, and natural gases that have high carbon content. Coal is the highest with 223 pounds of carbon dioxide per million British thermal units, followed by oil with 163 pounds of carbon dioxide per million British thermal units, and lastly naturalalready gases with 117 pounds of carbon dioxide per million British thermal units.

All of the countries in the world benefit from the existence of fossil fuels while the world itself suffers from its recoil. The Earth's atmosphere takes damage for every non-renewable energy that is used. When fossil fuels are burned, enormous volumes of carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas, are discharged into the atmosphere. Global warming is caused by greenhouse gases, which confine heat in our atmosphere. The average global temperature has alrelady risen by 1 degree Celcius. Warming exceeding 1.5 degree Celcius increases the risk of escalating sea lvels, harsh weather, biodiversity loss and extinction, food scarcity, and increasing health and poverty for millions of people around the world.

During the year 1988, it is said that it was the starting point of when global warming gets real. The global temperature suddenly increased and it was a critical point when watershed events placed global warming in the spotlight. In that same year it marked the beginning of the worldwide problem that scientist are aware of what it might do and what it can bring upon us. What started in the summer of the year 1988 became o much serious matter and now in the year 2022, scientists in the United Nation are desperate, crying, begging, and are arrested. In April year 2022, scientists protested "End Fossil Fuels Now" and "Let the Earth Breathe."

## Problem Statement
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has determined that fossil fuel emissions are the major contributor to global warming. Fossil fuels and industry reported 89 percent of worldwide CO2 emissions in 2018. Coal is a fossil fuel that is the dirtiest of them all, accounting for more than 0.3°C of the 1°C rise in global average temperatures. As a result, it is the single largest contributor to global warming. When oil is burned, it releases a significant amount of carbon, accounting for around a third of global carbon emissions. In recent years, there have also been sequences of oil leaks that have wreaked havoc on our ocean's environment. Natural gas is commonly advertised as a more environmentally friendly energy source than coal and oil. Natural gas, on the other hand, is still a fossil fuel that contributes a fifth of global carbon emissions.  (4)

According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), human-induced climate change is creating a hazardous and pervasive disturbance in nature, affecting the lives of billions of people around the world. People and ecosystems that are least able to cope are the ones who suffer the most. Heatwaves, droughts, and floods are already pushing plants and animals to their limits, causing mass extinctions in species like forests and corals. These weather extremes are happening at the same time, resulting in cascade effects that are becoming more difficult to manage. They have put millions of people in jeopardy of running out of food and water, particularly in Africa, Asia, Central and South America, small islands, and the Arctic. To minimize further loss of life, wildlife, and infrastructure, immediate, ambitious, and swift action is needed.

The combustion of fossil fuels emits long-lived greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide and short-lived pollutants such as sulfur dioxide, all of which contribute to the creation of atmospheric aerosols. Aerosols in the atmosphere can chill the climate, disguising some of the warming effects caused by greenhouse gas emissions. When inhaled, however, aerosol particulates are exceedingly hazardous, resulting in millions of early deaths each year. As a result, phasing out unchecked fossil-fuel combustion would not only improve health but will also lessen the extent to which greenhouse-gas-induced warming is concealed by aerosols. (6)

Studies by various scientists in the United Nations showed that the planet earth only has 3-5 years left before its end. It is stated in their studies that the continuous use of fossil fuels is the one major factor. Every fossil fuel that is burned emits greenhouse gases that entrap heat in the atmosphere. From air and water pollution to global warming, using fossil fuels for energy has taken a huge toll on humans and the environment. That's in addition to the detrimental consequences of petroleum-based items like plastics and chemicals.
