# Project Title: Let the Earth Breathe. Weather You Like It or Not.

### Introduction

Who would have thought that the past will greatly influence the way people of the present lives? Remains from plants and animals that existed millions of years ago play a major role in how we humans live our lives. These remains are the so-called "Fossil Fuels" which are considered a source of non-renewable energy that is being used in different aspects of life. Fossil Fuels are essential for human survival and daily living, and they are the world's principal energy source. They are utilized in the production of ordinary products such as computers, cosmetics, paint, household appliances, heating, transportation, and electricity generation. The most common source of non-renewable energy is typically known as coal, crude oil, and natural gases that have high carbon content. Coal is the highest with 223 pounds of carbon dioxide per million British thermal units, followed by oil with 163 pounds of carbon dioxide per million British thermal units, and lastly naatural gases with 117 pounds of carbon dioxide per million British thermal units.

All of the countries in the world benefit from the existence of fossil fuels while the world itself suffers from its recoil. The Earth's atmosphere takes damage for every non-renewable energy that is used. When fossil fuels are burned, enormous volumes of carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas, are discharged into the atmosphere. Global warming is caused by greenhouse gases, which confine heat in our atmosphere. The average global temperature has alrelady risen by 1 degree Celcius. Warming exceeding 1.5 degree Celcius increases the risk of escalating sea lvels, harsh weather, biodiversity loss and extinction, food scarcity, and increasing health and poverty for millions of people around the world.
